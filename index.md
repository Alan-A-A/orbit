![Orbit Framework](tpl/orbit-logo-black.png)

 <br/>

Orbit is a modern Java framework that makes it easier to build and maintain distributed,
secure and scalable online services.

Orbit contains two primary components. Orbit Actors, a framework to write distributed systems using virtual actors, and Orbit Container, a minimal inversion of control container for building online services.

It was developed by [BioWare](http://www.bioware.com), a division of [Electronic Arts](http://www.ea.com), and is available under the [BSD 3-Clause License](https://github.com/electronicarts/orbit/blob/master/LICENSE).
