Overview {#AboutOrbit-Overview}
----------


Orbit is a modern Java framework that makes it easier to build and maintain distributed, secure and scalable online services.


Orbit contains two primary components: Orbit Actors, a framework to write distributed systems using virtual actors, and Orbit Container, a minimal inversion of control container for building online services.


It was developed by [BioWare](http://www.bioware.com/), a division of [Electronic Arts](http://www.ea.com/), and is available under the [BSD 3-Clause License](https://github.com/electronicarts/orbit/blob/master/LICENSE).


 


Orbit Actors {#AboutOrbit-OrbitActors}
----------


Orbit Actors is a framework to write distributed systems using virtual actors. It abstracts much of the work that programmers are usually required to perform in order to work with distributed actors such state management, actor addressability and actor lifetime.

Orbit Container {#AboutOrbit-OrbitContainer}
----------


Orbit Container is a minimal inversion of control container designed to make writing and managing applications easier by simplifying object injection, service location, application configuration and dependency management. It abstracts the implementation details of the underlying technology away from programmers and operations engineers who are able to develop and maintain different technologies with a unified interface.
