[Hello World](orbit-actor-tutorial-hello-world.html) {#ActorTutorials-HelloWorld}
----------


This tutorial explains how to create a Hello World example using Orbit Actors. It shows using a single-module in a single-process environment, often useful for development purposes.


[Crossing JVM Boundaries](orbit-actor-tutorial-crossing-jvm-boundaries.html) {#ActorTutorials-CrossingJVMBoundaries}
----------


In the Hello World example we created a single-process application. This tutorial shows a more standard configuration running across multiple JVMs.


[Structuring Your Project](orbit-actor-tutorial-structuring-your-project.html) {#ActorTutorials-StructuringYourProject}
----------


In the previous examples we've been working with a single-module application. This tutorial describes how you can structure larger projects in a cleaner way.


[Using State](orbit-actor-tutorial-using-state.html) {#ActorTutorials-UsingState}
----------


In this example, we'll adapt the original Hello World example to use state. This tutorial shows you how to create a persistent and stateful actor.


[Observers](orbit-actor-tutorial-observers.html) {#ActorTutorials-Observers}
----------


In this example we'll take a look at the Observer pattern in Orbit. This tutorial shows you how to create an external observer to an actor.


[Cross Actor Communication](orbit-actor-tutorial-cross-actor-communication.html) {#ActorTutorials-CrossActorCommunication}
----------


In this example we'll take a look at how actors can communicate with one another. This tutorial will show you how actors can communicate with one another without using a stage.
